/// C source code, test files and visualization routines for the simulations in "Numerical scheme for a spatially inhomogeneous matrix-valued quantum Boltzmann equation" (see References).
///
/// Compiling the source code:
/// - Windows: a Visual Studio project file is provided in the *vcproj* folder
/// - Linux and similar: see the makefile in the *bin* folder; you may have to adapt paths according to your local installation
///
/// The *visualization* subfolder contains Matlab routines for visualizing the binary output files of the simulation code. Call loadHomBinary() and loadInhomBinary('../bin/params_periodic_example.txt') for visualizing the spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous simulation examples, respectively.
